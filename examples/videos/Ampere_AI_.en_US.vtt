My name is Victor. I'm the head of AI at Ampere.
We have a little AI demo right here

2
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.280 
To demonstrate how Altra and Altra Max can
run all sorts of AI workloads whether  

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.060 
you're using TensorFlow, Pytorch or any other
standard software. So what we're having here is

4
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.250 
a live video feed from Jackson Hole with 
cars on the intersection  

5
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.020 
What we can show here is that using our Altra Max
and our AIO - AI Optimizer for 

6
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.060 
TensorFlow, PyTorch and other standard frameworks.

7
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.230 
We can accelerate those standard Computer Vision,

8
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.000 
Natural Language Processing or Recommendation Engine
workloads to run very very efficiently on our chips.

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.040 
For example, in this case, we can achieve 
real-time performance meaning 30 frames

10
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.190
per second on a live video feed just using 6 vCPUs
of our chip and Altra Max comes with up

11
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.030 
to 128 cores so you can imagine how many of 
those workloads you can run simultaneously.
